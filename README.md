Proyecto 1 de Sistemas Operativos

## Nix

This project uses Nix for it's dependencies, make sure to always have the most
up to date flake and run:

```bash
# On the project root
nix develop
```

To enter a shell with all the necessary dependencies to develop on the project.

## Zig build system

Is kinda complicated to modify/build stuff if you don't know anything about the
build system. But as a user is really simple to use!

```bash
# To see which commands are available
zig build --help
```
